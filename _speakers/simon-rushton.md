  description: In the early summer of 2016, certain that 'learning begins outside your comfort zone', Plymouth School of Creative Arts became one of the very first schools to begin to explore how AI in the form of a subject agnostic intelligent adaptive learning platform (initially populated with Maths content) could be used to help learners to develop knowledge and understanding of a depth and quality that was better than would otherwise have been possible.
