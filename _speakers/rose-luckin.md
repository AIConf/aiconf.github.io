about: Rose Luckin is Professor of Learner Centred Design at UCL Knowledge Lab in London. Her research involves the design and evaluation of educational technology using theories from the learning sciences and techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI). She has a particular interest in using AI to open up the 'black box' of learning to show teachers and students the detail of their progress intellectually, emotionally and socially. Rose is also Director of EDUCATE&#58; a London hub for Educational Technology StartUps, researchers and educators to work together on the development of evidence-based Educational Technology. Rose is lead author of Nesta's influential 'Decoding Learning' report published in 2012 and Pearson's Unleashing Intelligence, published in 2016. She is a UFI charity trustee, a governor and trustee of St Paul's school in London and a governor of the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton. She has taught in the state secondary, Further Education and Higher Education sectors, and she was previously Pro-Vice Chancellor for Teaching and Learning at the University of Sussex.

  description: Most people frequently interact with Artificial Intelligence (AI). For example, when they use their e-passport to enter a country, search using google, or ask Siri to perform a simple task for them. AI is also already being applied to educational settings. For example, UK-based Century Tech, has developed a learning platform with input from neuroscientists that tracks students’ interactions, from every mouse movement and each keystroke. Century’s AI looks for patterns and correlations in the data from the student, their year group, and their school to offer a personalised learning journey for the student. It also provides teachers with a dashboard, giving them a real-time snapshot of the learning status of every child in their class. In addition to the potential value that AI could bring to education if we prepare ourselves appropriately, there are the changes that AI brings to the modern workplace that mean our students need a different range of knowledge, skills and expertise. Teaching will need to adapt to meet these needs. <br><br>The purpose of this talk is to explore how AI is relevant to education and what AI can contribute to teaching and learning to help students and educators progress their understanding and knowledge more effectively.
