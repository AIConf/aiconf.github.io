about: >
  <p>Dr John Davies became Dean of Wells in late 2016.  He had previously served as Dean of Derby for six years, helping to restore the fabric of that Cathedral, as well as developing links between it and the city and county.</p>
  <br>
  <p>John’s role at Wells is to Chair the Cathedral Chapter, its governing body; to ensure really good connections between the Cathedral and its many stakeholders; and to care for its fabric and worship.  He is also a member of the Bishop’s senior staff team in the diocese.</p>
  <br>
  <p>John also serves on the governing body of Wells Cathedral School which sits in close proximity to the Cathedral and which has very strong links with the Cathedral’s music.
  Previously John had been a market town parish priest, an Oxford college chaplain and an inner city incumbent.  He has strong interests in theology and the role of the church in today’s society.</p>
