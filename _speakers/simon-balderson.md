    description: Artificial Intelligence has traditionally been confined to problems with a tightly-defined remit, such as playing chess, relying on vast processing power and a controlled set of rules. Machine learning has allowed computers to encroach further and further into areas which we previously considered to be 'uniquely human', such as natural language processing, image recognition, even composition and creative writing. This keynote address will question what the future holds for all of us and for the young people we are educating.

    title: Adaptive Learning Systems - why all the fuss?
    date: 2018-05-19
    time_start: "11:00"
    time_end: "12:00"
    building: Cedars Hall
    room: Digital Studio
    description: The goal of education for many years has been to provide a 'personalised learning experience', for each individual pupil. Adaptive learning systems, enhanced by machine learning algorithms, seem to offer the promise of this finally becoming a reality. How will this affect the role of teachers? Will teachers even be needed, when adaptive systems can do a better job of providing exactly the right level of challenge and support, for any given pupil?
