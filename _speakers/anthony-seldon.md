    description: Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham and former master of Wellington College, predicts that within the next 10 years, the best teachers of the future will be replaced with intelligent machines. Teachers will remain in classrooms to set up equipment and maintain discipline according to Sir Anthony, but they will simply be assistants while the real education is done by artificial intelligence. "It certainly will change human life as we know it. It will open up the possibility of an Eton or Wellington education for all" said Sir Anthony.<br><br>In the fourth revolution, children will progress at their own pace and be chaperoned in their learning by artificial intelligence.<br><br>"The machines will be extraordinarily inspirational. You&#39;ll still have the humans there walking around during school time, but in fact the inspiration in terms of intellectual excitement will come from the lighting-up of the brain which the machines will be superbly well-geared for. The machines will know what it is that most excites you and give you a natural level of challenge that is not too hard or too easy, but just right for you”.
